# sorken
Glider SG 38 was constructed by Flugzeugbau Schneider Grunau in Germany in the mid-1930s. In Sweden, the license plane was manufactured by Kockums Aerospace in Malmo, which was also selling kits to  aero-clubs. The Air Force ordered their kits from AB Aerospace (AFI) in Halmstad. The Air Force called the SG-38 for G101. There’s no inside cockpit, but the ouside is nearly a copy of the one hanging inside Visby terminal airport. The name “Sorken” is equal to a “small boy” in Gotland.
